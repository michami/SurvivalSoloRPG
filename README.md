## Survival Solo RPG:

Use two d4 dice valued 0 to 3. Use some kind of tokens to indicate traits. Trait default values can be represented by notches on a stick, etc. See [additional dice notes](additional dice notes.md) for more information on the dice. "3" is the magic number for many of the rules.

### Oracle:
Roll one die as an oracle.  Roll multiple times to get modifiers.

| Die  | Trait     | Element | Race  | Relationship| Fighting Style | Gender     | No / Yes       |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| 0    | HP        | Earth   | Dwarf | Family      | Support        | Manly man  | Definitely No  |
| 1    | STR       | Water   | Human | Friend      | Fighter        | Male       | Probably No    |
| 2    | DEX       | Air     | Elf   | Lovers      | Thief          | Female     | Probably Yes   |
| 3    | INT       | Fire    | Beast | Enemy       | Magic User     | Girly girl | Definitely Yes |

For ranged values, roll two dice to get a value from 0 (very bad) to 6 (very good) with 3 being the average.

### Races

**Dwarf:** Elemental magic. Durable elemental weapons.

**Human:** Electrical magic. Electronics. Constructs. Complex mechanical traps. Complex weapons such as firearms, crossbows, etc.

**Elf:** Any nature / spiritual magic, healing others, golems, sentient weapons.

**Beast-kin:** Self transformation / boosting magic. Can change into an animal with +1/2 point per level, rounded up, to traits based on animal type. Can change into a human with +1/2 point per level, rounded up, to INT. Animal form cannot use weapons or armor. Can only use magic, other than transforming, in their natural form. The difficulty to transform is easy (6) using the unmodified INT level.

Any race can learn the magic of another race through practice. Since this is not natural for the race, no more than 3 spells from other races can be learned.

### Character

**Traits:** Each attacking character has four traits, HP, STR, DEX and INT. Start with 12 points and distribute as desired. Traits have a starting max of level 4.

**Lucky Shots:** You may trade one or more trait points for 3 lucky shots each. One lucky shot is exchanged for an extra roll at any time, picking the more preferred result. Lucky shots are restored whenever you gain an XP.

**Charisma:** Charisma uses INT. Roll INT for both characters. Must beat the target's score to win. Modifiers can be used based on the circumstances.

### Fighting

**Rolling the dice:** Roll 2 dice and add the appropriate trait. Any time you use INT, choose how many levels to use, then temporarily drop INT by that many levels. You regain one lost level of INT per turn.

**Challenge Difficulties:** Trivial(4), Easy(6), Medium(8), Hard(10), and Heroic(12). Roll to match or better. Rolling 0 (6.25%) always fails.

**Fray die:** Before hero attacks an enemy, roll one die. If it's a 3, do 1 damage to the opponent before attacking. These are attacks "in the fray" such as dagger swipes, critical hits, etc.

**Speed (DEX) based attacks:** Attacker rolls on DEX. Defender rolls on either DEX (dodge) or STR (block). If the attacker rolls higher than the defender, the difference is the damage done.

**Strength (STR) based attacks:** Roll on DEX for both attacker and defender. If the defender rolls higher, this is the amount of damage dodged. Then the attacker and defender roll on STR. If the attacker rolls higher, this is the damage done, minus the damage dodged.

**Magic attacks:** Because of the different ways magic can be used, there are no set rules for magic. Your magic level is your INT, and depending on the spell, may be used in place of DEX or STR using the same rules as above. These rules may be modified for the spell used, such as AoE spells.

**Damage overflow:** If you do more damage than a single enemy can take, you can spend the overflow damage on an enemy, of equal or less level, adjacent to the first. This can be repeated for as many enemies are there are, as long as they are adjacent to each other. Any one of the remaining enemies can return an attack before you attack again.

**Weapons and armor:** Weapons add (or subtract) levels to your attack rolls. Armor adds (or subtracts) levels to your defense rolls.

**Saving throws:** If poisoned, burning, etc. roll for easy difficulty (6) on your STR or INT. If you fail the save, you lose one HP and must roll again on your next turn. Repeat until you succeed or your HP reaches 0. If your HP reaches 0 for any reason, including battle, roll for hard difficulty (10) on INT for divine intervention. If you succeed in a divine intervention, restore 1 HP and remove all status effects. (Negative and positive)

**Breaking Objects:** Objects only have a LVL. Attacker rolls on STR to beat the LVL difficulty.

**Traps:** Traps have a LVL which must be beat with INT to disarm. LVL acts like DEX if triggered. When creating a trap, roll on INT to find the trap's LVL. A failed roll to disarm will trigger the trap.

**Constructs and Golems:** Roll on INT for the level. Use the rules for monsters to determine how many trait points to distribute.

**Meditation:** When not in battle, you can choose to meditate. For each turn you meditate, you increase your INT by one on your next INT roll. There is also a 50% chance to be attacked by a low-level monster each turn.  If your meditation is interrupted, you loose the INT bonus and the monster attacks first.

**Leveling:** At the end of a single adventure, (or whenever you feel is right) each hero gets one XP and all spent lucky shots are restored. You need the number of the next level more XP to advance to that level. (level 4 is 4 XP higher than level 3) Each time you level up, you get 2 points you can choose to spend on any traits or lucky shot tokens.

**Healing:** Each ally can heal 1 HP between battles. Elves may attempt to perform a full heal at a medium(8) difficulty, or raise the dead at a hard(10) difficulty. Beast-kin may attempt a full heal on themselves.

**Monsters:** A level 1 monster has 4 total trait points. (Often one point to each trait) Monsters level the same way as Heroes, so a level 5 monster will have 8 additional trait points, or 12 total, the same as a level 1 hero.

**Creating a Map:** Roll multiple dice, or a single dice multiple times to find what exits the current room has. Zero is the way you entered the room, 1 is to the left, 2 is straight ahead, 3 is to the right. Ignore duplicate values. Ask the oracle about any room features.
