## Survival Solo RPG:

Use two d4 dice valued 0 to 3. Use rocks as tokens to indicating values that change during play. Trait values can be represented by notches on a stick, etc. See [additional dice notes](additional_dice_notes.md) for more information on the dice. "3" is the magic number for many of the rules.

### Oracle:
Roll one die as an oracle.  Roll multiple times to get modifiers.

| Die  | Trait     | Element | Race  | Relationship| Fighting Style | Gender     | No / Yes       |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| 0    | HP        | Earth   | Dwarf | Family      | Support        | Manly man  | Definitely No  |
| 1    | STR       | Water   | Human | Friend      | Fighter        | Male       | Probably No    |
| 2    | DEX       | Air     | Elf   | Lovers      | Thief          | Female     | Probably Yes   |
| 3    | INT       | Fire    | Beast | Enemy       | Magic User     | Girly girl | Definitely Yes |

For ranged values, roll two dice to get a value from 0 (very bad) to 6 (very good) with 3 being the average.

### Races

**Dwarf:** Elemental magic. Durable elemental weapons.

**Human:** Electrical magic. Electronics. Constructs. Complex mechanical traps. Complex weapons such as firearms, crossbows, etc.

**Elf:** Nature / spiritual magic, healing others, golems, sentient weapons.

**Beast-kin:** Self transformation / boosting magic. When changing into an animal, manna tokens are redistributed to traits based on animal type. When changing into full human, manna tokens are added to INT for charisma checks. Animal form cannot use weapons or armor. Beast-kin can only use magic in their natural form. Transformation always succeeds and takes one full turn.

Any race can learn the magic of another race through practice. Since this is not natural for the race, no more than 3 spells from other races can be learned.

### Character

**Traits:** Each attacking character has four traits, HP, STR, DEX and INT. Start with 12 points and distribute as desired.

**Lucky Shots:** You may trade trait points for 3 lucky shots each. One lucky shot is exchanged for an extra roll at any time, picking the more preferred result. Lucky shots are restored whenever you gain an XP.

**Charisma:** Charisma uses INT. Roll INT for both characters. Must beat the target's score to win. Modifiers can be used based on the circumstances.

**Magic:** You have one manna (magic) token per level of INT. When you use manna, choose how many levels to use, then temporarily drop your manna by that many tokens. You regain one lost manna token per turn up to INT tokens.

### Fighting

**Rolling the dice:** Roll 2 dice and add the appropriate trait.

**Challenge Difficulties:** Trivial(4), Easy(6), Medium(8), Hard(10), and Heroic(12). Roll to match or better. Rolling 0 (6.25%) always fails.

**Fray die:** Before a hero attacks an enemy, roll one die. If it's a 3, do 1 damage to the opponent before attacking. These are attacks "in the fray" such as dagger swipes, critical hits, etc.

**Speed (DEX) based attacks:** Attacker rolls on DEX. Defender rolls on either DEX (dodge) or STR (block). If the attacker rolls higher than the defender, the difference is the damage done.

**Strength (STR) based attacks:** Roll on DEX for both attacker and defender. If the defender rolls higher, this is the amount of damage dodged. Then the attacker and defender roll on STR. If the attacker rolls higher, this is the damage done, minus the damage dodged.

**Magic attacks:** Because of the different ways magic can be used, there are no set rules or spells. Depending on the spell, magic may be used in place of DEX or STR using the same rules as above. Many magic spells will only require a difficulty check for success.

**Damage overflow:** If you do more damage than a single enemy can take, you can spend the overflow damage on an enemy, of equal or less level, adjacent to the first. This can be repeated for as many enemies are there are, as long as they are adjacent to each other. Any one of the remaining enemies can return an attack before you attack again.

**Weapons and armor:** Weapons add (or subtract) levels to your attack rolls. Armor adds (or subtracts) levels to your defense rolls.

**Saving throws:** If poisoned, burning, etc. roll for easy difficulty (6) on your STR or HP. If you fail the save, you lose one HP and must roll again on your next turn. Repeat until you succeed or your HP reaches 0. If your HP reaches 0 for any reason, including battle, roll for hard difficulty (10) on INT for divine intervention. If you succeed in a divine intervention, restore 1 HP and remove all status effects. (Negative and positive)

**Breaking Objects:** Objects only have a LVL. Attacker rolls on STR to beat the LVL difficulty.

**Traps:** Traps have a LVL which must be beat with INT to disarm. LVL acts like DEX if triggered. A failed roll to disarm will trigger the trap. When creating a trap, roll on INT to find the trap's LVL.

**Constructs and Golems:** Roll on manna for the level. The pet gets 2x the rolled value of trait points. Manna used to create a pet does not regenerate until the pet dies or is dismissed. Manna boosts from meditation may be used.

**Meditation:** You can choose to meditate once after each battle. To meditate, roll one die. If it's 0 or 1, a monster will find you and have first attack. If it's 2 or 3, your meditation is successful and you get a temporary 1 point manna boost. You keep this manna boost until it is used. The manna boosts stack if not spent.

**Leveling:** At the end of a single encounter, each hero gets one XP and one spent lucky shot is restored. You need the number of the next level more XP to advance to that level. (level 4 is 4 XP higher than level 3) Each time you level up, you get 2 points you can choose to spend on any traits or lucky shot tokens.

**Healing:** Each ally can heal 1 HP between battles. Elves and Beast-kin may attempt to perform a full heal at a trivial(4) + target level difficulty. Elves may attempt to raise the dead at an easy(6) + target level difficulty.

**Monsters:** Monsters and pets get LEVEL x 2 total trait points. A level 6 monster will have 12 total trait points, the same as a level 1 hero.

**Creating a Map:** Roll multiple dice, or a single dice multiple times to find what exits the current room has. Zero is the way you entered the room, 1 is to the left, 2 is straight ahead, 3 is to the right. Ignore duplicate values. Ask the oracle about any room features.
