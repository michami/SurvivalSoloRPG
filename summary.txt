Rules Summary:

Use 3 D4 dice carved from sticks, and marked from 0 to 3. Each character has 4 traits, HP, STR, DEX, and INT.
For each trait, you make a pile of tokens (pebbles, etc.), one token for each point in the trait.
When making an attack or performing a challenge, roll at or above a calculated DC, with a DC 5 being 50% likely.
The DC is calculated by comparing the number of tokens in your trait to the LVL of the enemy.
You can spend tokens to shift the dice up or down, but doing so may change the DC of the next roll.
If your final score is 3+ over the DC, you do an extra point of damage.

It uses a soft magic system. Spend INT tokens and adding that to a roll.
A score of 5 is required to perform any damaging magic, 10 for major damage, and 15 for large scale magic.

All tokens, except HP and tokens spend on long running spells, are restored at the end of each encounter.
You can also restore one token of your choice by skipping your turn.

The dice are also used as an oracle to help with story progress:

0: HP, Earth, Dwarf, Manly Male, Family, Past, Solemn, "No"
1: STR, Water, Human, Male, Friend, Relaxed, Social, "Unlikely"
2: DEX, Air, Elf, Female, Lovers, Excited, Active, "Probably"
3: INT, Fire, Beast-kin, Girly Female, Danger, Enemy, Scared, Protective, "Yes"

For example:
Q: What gender and race is that person at the tavern?
A: 2, 0: A Female Dwarf

Q: What is her attitude twards me?
A: 3: Standoffish, or maybe she hates humans, so she's glaring at me
