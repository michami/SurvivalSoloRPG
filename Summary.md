### Oracle:
Roll one die as an oracle.  Roll multiple times to get modifiers.

| Die  | Trait     | Element | Race  | Relationship| Fighting Style | Gender     | No / Yes       |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| 0    | HP        | Earth   | Dwarf | Family      | Support        | Manly man  | Definitely No  |
| 1    | STR       | Water   | Human | Friend      | Fighter        | Male       | Probably No    |
| 2    | DEX       | Air     | Elf   | Lovers      | Thief          | Female     | Probably Yes   |
| 3    | INT       | Fire    | Beast | Enemy       | Magic User     | Girly girl | Definitely Yes |

**Dwarf:** Elemental magic. Durable elemental weapons.

**Human:** Electrical magic. Electronics. Constructs. Complex mechanical traps. Complex weapons such as firearms, crossbows, etc.

**Elf:** Any nature / spiritual magic, healing others, golems, sentient weapons.

**Beast-kin:** Self transformation / boosting magic. Can change into an animal with +1/2 point per level, rounded up, to traits based on animal type. Can change into a human with +1/2 point per level, rounded up, to INT. The difficulty to transform is Easy(6) using the unmodified INT level.

Any race can learn 3 spells from other races.

**Character:** Start with 12 trait points, max 4 each, and distribute as desired. Trade one or more trait points for 3 lucky shots each.

**Difficulties:** Trivial(4), Easy(6), Medium(8), Hard(10), and Heroic(12). Roll to match or better. Rolling 0 (6.25%) always fails.

**Attacking:** Roll one fray die. Do 1 damage on a 3. For DEX attacks, damage is difference in DEX. For STR attacks, difference in DEX is damaged dodged, difference in STR is damage. Excess damage overflows to adjacent, enemies of equal level.

**Saving throws:** If poisoned, burning, etc. roll for easy difficulty (6) on your STR or INT. If failed, lose one HP and roll again on next turn. If your HP reaches 0, roll for hard difficulty (10) on INT for divine intervention. If you succeed in a divine intervention, restore 1 HP and remove all status effects.

**Objects:** Have a LVL to break with STR or disarm with INT.

**Meditation:** When not in battle, you can choose to meditate. For each turn you meditate, you increase your INT by one on your next INT roll. There is also a 50% chance to be attacked by a low-level monster.  If your meditation is interrupted, you loose the INT bonus and the monster attacks first.

**Leveling:** At the end of a single adventure, each hero gets one XP and all spent lucky shots are restored. You need the number of the next level more XP to advance to that level. Each time you level up, you get 2 trait points.

**Healing:** Each ally can heal up to 2 HP between battles. Elves may attempt to perform a full heal at a medium(8) difficulty, or raise the dead at a hard(10) difficulty.

**Monsters:** A level 1 monster has 4 total trait points. (Often one point to each trait) Monsters level the same way as Heroes, so a level 5 monster is equal to a level 1 hero.
